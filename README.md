Question #1- https://editor.p5js.org/evansoucy17/sketches/r_d9XgVfV

For this question I created a function that created shapes using loops. I rewated the video to make sure I got the correct syntax. Once I got that I 
created a function called drawFlower. I filled out everything else I wanted then added the syntax- for (let petalsDrawn = 0; petalsDrawn < 36; 
petalsDrawn++). I had a little bit of trouble once I added the push and pop becuase it messed up the location as well as the arc of my flower. But I messed
around until i fixed it.

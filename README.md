Question #1- https://editor.p5js.org/evansoucy17/sketches/r_d9XgVfV

For this question I created a function that created shapes using loops. I rewatched the video to make sure I got the correct syntax. Once I got that I 
created a function called drawFlower. I filled out everything else I wanted then added the syntax- for (let petalsDrawn = 0; petalsDrawn < 36; 
petalsDrawn++). I had a little bit of trouble once I added the push and pop becuase it messed up the location as well as the arc of my flower. But I messed
around until i fixed it. This code draws several flowers of different sizes and positions. Each flower consists of a black circle in the center and 36 red petals arranged in a circular pattern. In addition, each flower has a green stem that extends downward from the center.



Question #2- https://editor.p5js.org/evansoucy17/sketches/30saUAv2r

The biggest change made from the original code was the removal of the stems so the pattern works better. This code creates a pattern of flowers without stems using nested loops in p5.js. The flowers are drawn on a 400x400 canvas, with 5 rows and 5 columns of flowers evenly spaced apart. The flower petals are colored red, with a black center, and each flower has 36 petals that are rotated by 10 degrees to create a spiral effect. The code uses the push() and pop() functions to save and restore the current transformation matrix, respectively.

Question #3- https://editor.p5js.org/evansoucy17/sketches/-BSDPcmiQ

For this assignment I made a lot of changes. For this code I added two more flower functions with nested loops to create a more complicated grid pattern.
I then created a color array and had the code chose a random color in the array for the flower petals every time the code is refreshed. I also went in and modified the code so that every time it is refreshed the number of petals change. I did this by changing the rotate variable to random and setting a limit of how many degrees the petal could rotate. When I first did assignment 2 I didn't completely understand that multiple shapes per aquare were required so that is why there is such a drastic change between question 2 and 3.
 
Question #4- https://editor.p5js.org/evansoucy17/sketches/qPCLrL6sC

For this assignment I created code that draws a pattern of flowers life a life cycle. The life cycle has five stages: birth, growth, bloom, decay, and death. Each stage is associated with a color, which is used to fill the petals of the flowers. I reused the flower function from my previous assignment. I created arrays for the flower grid as well as the life stages and used loops to create the grid.

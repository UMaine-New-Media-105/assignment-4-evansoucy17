Question #1- https://editor.p5js.org/evansoucy17/sketches/r_d9XgVfV

For this question I created a function that created shapes using loops. I rewatched the video to make sure I got the correct syntax. Once I got that I 
created a function called drawFlower. I filled out everything else I wanted then added the syntax- for (let petalsDrawn = 0; petalsDrawn < 36; 
petalsDrawn++). I had a little bit of trouble once I added the push and pop becuase it messed up the location as well as the arc of my flower. But I messed
around until i fixed it. This code draws several flowers of different sizes and positions. Each flower consists of a black circle in the center and 36 red petals arranged in a circular pattern. In addition, each flower has a green stem that extends downward from the center.



Question #2- https://editor.p5js.org/evansoucy17/sketches/30saUAv2r

The biggest change made from the original code was the removal of the stems so the pattern works better. This code creates a pattern of flowers without stems using nested loops in p5.js. The flowers are drawn on a 400x400 canvas, with 5 rows and 5 columns of flowers evenly spaced apart. The flower petals are colored red, with a black center, and each flower has 36 petals that are rotated by 10 degrees to create a spiral effect. The code uses the push() and pop() functions to save and restore the current transformation matrix, respectively.
